# Ziya's Progress Journal

** Time: 4:30pm-5:30pm**

** Duration: 1 h**

- Verified that we're working with the audio files (not LFS pointers)
- Played around with more EDA stuff
    - Generated random training data file's spectrogram & waveform
        - Load w/ librosa & plots an STFT spectrogram
    - Analyzed data @ TRAIN_PATH to write eda_train_inventory.csv w/ path, size_bytes, duration, and sr
    - Analyzed CSV w/ stats for size_bytes, duration, sr
    - Plotted duration & sr histograms w/ seaborn & matplotlib

**Time:** 2:00pm–4:45pm

**Duration:** 2h 45m
 
- Set up Git/GitHub workflow (cloning, gitignore, branches, tried working w/ LFS for large files)
- Resolved dataset access by pulling real audio from BiWaveGAN GitLab repo via Git LFS
- Set up local config file system so each collaborator can use their own data path without pushing it to GitHub
- Began EDA: confirmed sample rate (250kHz) and call duration (~40ms) on a single file
- Computed dataset-wide call duration distribution
- Checked RMS energy across files to screen for bad detections
- Confirmed train/test split is 90/10 and well-stratified by strain
- Identified strain imbalance (DBA: 20,265 train files vs. C57: 8,064 train files)
- Decided to filter dataset to DBA only for training + testing
